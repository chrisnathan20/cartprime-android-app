Varun

– Bug/ Error fixes
-Fixed invalid or illegal input for passwords on customer registration page
-Fixed bugs with recylerview while fetching data from the database, null pointer errors
-Fixed errors with sending an arraylist with an intent using parcelable, when that got really buggy, converted it into a string array(encoded) and then at destination activity sliced the strings to make it back into the ArrayList<Item> (decoded)
-Fixed an error with the database where every order that was placed was overwriting the whole orders section of the database by using HashSets<> more carefully and at the right place.
-Ensured clicking on the listview would send customers to desired store instead of crashing the application
-Replaced a textView field for displaying messages of successfully added/deleted items or how many of one item in the cart because it was incoherent with 3 different toast messages.
-Changed the toString() for item for my encoding and decoding from before to avoid bugs with the delimiter. Added ; as a delimiter to split strings properly to recreate items.
-Since reference type objects are linked and sometimes modifying them with different names but same references causes issues, used an ArrayList with repeated items and then in the next activity filtered their quantity with the number of occurrences.
-Added Dependencies to try and use databinding but when that did not work had to completely remove and delete the design I had made.
-While extracting the listview.selectedItem.toString() was having trouble finding it in the database, realised there were whitespaces and garbage residual data, used String.trim() to get rid of it.
